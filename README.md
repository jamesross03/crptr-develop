# Crptr
Crptr is a software that modifies data based on given probabilities and methods in order to simulate errors and variations occur in real-world data. 

Originally developed by [Ahmad Alsadeeqi](https://github.com/alsediqi) (see [original Crptr repository](https://github.com/alsediqi/crptr-old)). This fork was developed by [Tom Dalton](https://github.com/tomsdalton), to extend the existing application for PhD research to evaluate record linkage methods and algorithms. 

The software is written in Python 3.0 and consists of two main packages:
- `crptr` - the original Crptr application (updated to Python 3.0)
- `populations_crptr` - the extensions for use with population data.
