# Crptr
Crptr is a software that modifies data based on given probabilities and methods in order to simulate errors and variations occur in real-world data. 

Originally developed by [Ahmad Alsadeeqi](https://github.com/alsediqi) in Python 2 (see [original Crptr repository](https://github.com/alsediqi/crptr-old)), the application has been updated to Python 3.0 and minorly refactored but original functionality remains unchanged.
